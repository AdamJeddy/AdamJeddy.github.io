      "REVIEW": "This is a great anime. I grew up watching Naruto ever since I was 12 years old. It is a very special anime that is full of life lessons, one that taught me a lot ever since I started watching it. Naruto is a series full of action, fights, feels, friendship, beliefs, and most importantly, BONDS, and I grew up attached to these points and more to the characters.",

      "REVIEW": "I'm hyper-critical of sports in anime . I played volleyball for about 3 years as a Wing Spiker and occasionally a Middle Blocker but Haikyu!! wins everything and probably the sole reason I want to play so badly again. The sequences when they're playing are absolutely gorgeous. True to form and technique it looks like they're really playing. The matches themselves are intense, and I get the same feelings watching them as I did when I played in similar scenarios.",
